## 🎯 Key Features

### 👩‍🏫 Course & Lecture Management

* Create and manage courses and curriculum
* Upload video lectures, audio, and PDF notes
* Support for free and paid lectures

### 🎥 Live Lecture System

* Real‑time live class support
* Low‑latency interaction design
* Extensible to integrate video conferencing tools

### 👀 Attention Engine

* Computer vision–based microservice for analyzing student attentiveness during live lectures  
* Processes image frames via API in real time  
* Computes:
  * Face presence confidence  
  * Head pose confidence  
  * Gaze direction confidence  
* Aggregates signals into an overall attention score per student  
* Integrates seamlessly with live lecture sessions  
* Helps instructors monitor engagement and identify attention drops  
* Designed as an independent, scalable microservice that can be enabled per course

### 📝 Quizzes & Assessments

* Create quizzes per course or lecture
* Track student attempts and scores
* Scalable for objective evaluation

### 💬 Course Community Chat

* Course‑specific discussion channels
* Real‑time messaging via WebSockets
* Upvote‑based message relevance and moderation

### 🤖 AI Course Tutor

### 🧠 AI Summary Generator 

The **AI Summary Generator** automatically creates **concise, structured summaries per lecture** by processing the **audio of the lecture**.

- 🎧 Converts lecture audio → text  
- 🧠 Generates an AI-based summary for that specific lecture  
- 📌 Stores summaries lecture-wise for quick revision  

This enables students to revise faster and allows teachers to provide instant, high-quality recap material with zero manual effort.

## ⚙️ Installation (Local Setup)

> Tested locally for development. Adjust ports and environment variables for production deployments.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prasoon52/lms-by-tle-terminator.git
cd lms-by-tle-terminator
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env # Create your own .env and add required secrets
npm install
npm run dev
```

> backend will typically runs on port `8000` depending on configuration.

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env # Create your own .env and add required secrets
npm install
npm run dev
```

> frontend dev server typically runs on `localhost:5173` or as specified by Vite.

### 4. Attention Engine (Optional setup for focusing monitoring)

```bash
cd Attention_Engine
python3 -m venv venv # On Windows use `python -m venv venv`
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

cd ../attention_engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

> Attention Engine runs as a separate microservice (Flask). Configure frontend/backend to call the attention API endpoint when enabled.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Make sure you create `.env` files for backend and frontend as required.

- .env.example files are provided as templates.
- Fill in your own API keys, database URIs, and secrets.


**Do not commit `.env` files or secrets to version control.**
