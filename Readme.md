## 🚀 Overview

LMS by TLE Terminator is a modern web platform that enables:

* Structured course creation & enrollment
* Recorded and live lectures
* Quizzes and assessments
* Community chat & discussion
* AI‑powered doubt resolution
* Attention tracking engine (optional integration)

The platform aims to bridge the gap between teaching plans and classroom execution, especially for resource‑constrained or large‑scale education systems.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 👩‍🏫 Course & Lecture Management

* Create and manage courses and curriculum
* Upload video lectures, audio, and PDF notes
* Support for free and paid lectures

### 🎥 Live Lecture System

* Real‑time live class support
* Low‑latency interaction design
* Extensible to integrate video conferencing tools

### 📝 Quizzes & Assessments

* Create quizzes per course or lecture
* Track student attempts and scores
* Scalable for objective evaluation

### 💬 Course Community Chat

* Course‑specific discussion channels
* Real‑time messaging via WebSockets
* Upvote‑based message relevance and moderation

### 🤖 AI Course Tutor

* Course‑aware AI assistant that answers doubts using lecture context
* Embedding‑based retrieval from course materials
* Independent chat history per student
* Pluggable to local LLMs (e.g., Ollama) or API models

### 👀 Attention Engine (Optional)

* Computer vision–based attention analysis microservice
* Processes image frames via API and returns head/gaze/face confidence scores
* Integrates with live lectures to estimate student attentiveness

### 🧠 AI Summary Generator (New Feature)

The **AI Summary Generator** automatically creates **concise, structured summaries per lecture** by processing the **audio of the lecture**.

- 🎧 Converts lecture audio → text  
- 🧠 Generates an AI-based summary for that specific lecture  
- 📌 Stores summaries lecture-wise for quick revision  

This enables students to revise faster and allows teachers to provide instant, high-quality recap material with zero manual effort.

## ⚙️ Installation (Local Setup)

> Tested locally for development. Adjust ports and environment variables for production deployments.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prasoon52/lms-by-tle-terminator.git
cd lms-by-tle-terminator
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> backend typically runs on a port like `5000` or `5001` depending on configuration.

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> frontend dev server typically runs on `localhost:3000` or as specified by Vite.

### 4. (Optional) Attention Engine

```bash
cd Attention_Engine
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

cd ../attention_engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

> Attention Engine runs as a separate microservice (Flask). Configure frontend/backend to call the attention API endpoint when enabled.

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create `.env` files for backend and microservices as required.

Example `.env` keys (backend):

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=xxxx
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=xxxx
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=xxxx
ATTENTION_ENGINE_URL=http://localhost:7001
```

**Do not commit `.env` files or secrets to version control.**
